# Python MUST be installed to launch. 
To install on a district computer:
1. Lanuch company portal and install Python. 
2. Launch the installer with the file "C:\Program Files (x86)\Python38-32\python.exe"
3. The folder will automatically be created and an example file will appear. Replace the example wallpaper with the exact name 'wallpaper.jpeg' to replace it

# Other Notes
- The Westada School district changes the wallpaper setting to 'tile', so you will have to convert the image
into the same resolution as the display (unable to automate change)

- This is not to be used to harm the Westada School district or others. The purpose of this is to change 
your wallpaper. That's it.
